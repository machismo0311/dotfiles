## Summary

Headscale replaces the commercial Tailscale control plane for NetFRAME. It lets unlimited students connect to QuarkyLab's ML environment using the native Tailscale app, with per-semester lifecycle management via CLI. The commercial Tailscale free tier (6 seats) couldn't scale to ~15 students per semester.

Headscale handles **authentication and key distribution only** — it does not carry traffic. After registration, devices communicate peer-to-peer via WireGuard. If Headscale goes down, existing connections stay up.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ares MagicDNS permission error on `/etc/resolv.conf` | Open — non-critical, connectivity unaffected |
| Fernanda still on commercial Tailscale | Pending migration window |
| No TLS — server_url is plain HTTP | Planned: step-ca cert after VLAN 30 migration |
